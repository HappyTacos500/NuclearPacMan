            Move using the arrow keys and eat pellets. Getting a big white
            power pellet will let you eat ghosts for a little bit, but if you
            run into a ghost without a power pellet you will lost a life.
            If a ghost is killed, it will die for a few seconds and respawn.
            If you eat all of the pellets on a board, you level up and get
            100 points for doing so.

            You can drop bombs with the space bar, which you can use to
            blow up walls; you do have a limited amount of them however.
            Collecting a good bomb (the black circle with a checkmark) 
            gives you an additonal bomb. Going into a hole (the black
            circle with no checkmark) will teleport you to the other hole.

            If the nuke bar on the left is full (it'll turn green when
            it's full), you can press N to use it. Using a nuke kills all
            of the ghosts but also spawns one additional one.

            YOu can enter a portal (the spirals) to enter another universe.
            These universes won't level you up, but still make a new board.
