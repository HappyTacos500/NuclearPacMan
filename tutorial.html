    Move using the arrow keys and eat pellets. Getting a big white  
    power pellet will let you eat ghosts for a little bit, but if you  
    run into a ghost without a power pellet you will lost a life.  
    If a ghost is killed, it will die for a few seconds and respawn.  
    If you eat all of the pellets on a board, you level up and get  
    100 points.  
        
    You can drop bombs with the space bar, which you can use to  
    blow up walls; you do have a limited amount of them however.  
    Collecting a good bomb (the black circle with a checkmark)  
    gives you an additonal bomb. Going into a hole (the black  
    circle with no checkmark) will teleport you to the other hole.  
        
    If the nuke bar on the left is full (it'll turn green when  
    it's full), you can press N to use it. Using a nuke kills all  
    of the ghosts but also spawns one additional one.  
        
    You can enter a portal (the spirals) to enter another universe.  
    These universes won't level you up, but still make a new board. 
    Every 5 universes, a boss fight will start. During a boss fight,  
    you need to eat ghosts to damage the boss and drop it's health  
    to 0. If you eat all of the power pellets on the board without
    killing the boss, you get an instant game over, so be careful.
    If you manage to kill the boss, you get 200 points.
